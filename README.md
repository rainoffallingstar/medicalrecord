## Notes:How to write a medical record

By rainoffallingstar,8th May 2020

The patient’s medical record is a document containing: (1) the medical history, (2) the  findings  from the PE, (3) the reports of  laboratory tests, (4) the  findings and conclusions  from special  examinations, (5) the  findings and diagnoses of  consultants, (6) the diagnoses of  the responsible physician, (7) notes on treatment, including medication, surgical operations, radiation, physical therapy, and (8) progress notes by physicians, nurses, and others

### Outline 
The medical history is recorded in a standard sequence, differing minimally  from one institution to another. The  following sequence is suggested  for adults. A different order giving prominence to the birth history is often preferred by pediatricians.

1. Identification  
2. Informant
3. Chief  complaints (CCs)  
4. History of  present illness (HPI)  
5. Past medical and surgical history (PMH)  A. General health  B. Chronic illnesses and conditions  C. Operations and injuries  D. Hospitalizations  
6. Family history (FH)
7. Social history (SH)  
8. Review of  systems (ROSs)  
9. Medications  
10. Allergies and medication intolerances  
11. Preventive services, including immunizations
12. Physical examination (PE)  
13. Laboratory and imaging studies  
14. Assessment/ Problem list  
15. Plan
16. Inpatient progress notes 
17. Discharge summary 
18. Physician’s signature 

### Completion of the medical record 

 It is the clinician’s responsibility to see that the medical record is complete and accurate. Your signature attests to the accuracy of  the information and that you have verified it to your satisfaction. Once   Entered  and signed, the  information in the  medical   Record cannot be  altered, although addendums and corrections can be added.

Identification: These data are  frequently provided  or the clinician, but should be checked  for accuracy.
Patient’s name. Record the complete name, including the  family and given names, being careful to obtain correct spelling and birth date. When a married woman who has taken her husband’s name, place her husband’s given names in parentheses, as Brown, Mary Elizabeth (Mrs. Edward Charles), since she may sign her name as Mrs. Edward C. Brown in correspondence.

Sex and gender. Sex is determined by genetics, gender is the patient’s sexual identity. Usually, this is obvious, but specific  questions asked sensitively may be required.

Residence. The address should be confirmed and recorded; occasionally, addresses may be needed to distinguish patients with the same name.

Birth date and age. Record the patient’s birth date and stated age. The birth date may be needed to distinguish between patients with the same name.

Source of referral. When referred, confirmed  the reason  for referral and the name, address, telephone, and FAX numbers of  the referring clinician.
 
The informant 

Sources of the history. The history is best obtained  from the patient with supportive in formation  from others. Record your impression of  the historian’s accuracy and credibility.

Interpreters. Try to avoid untrained interpreters. The  following is a  frequent experience with a lay interpreter, especially a  family member. You ask, “Do you have pain?” The interpreter and patient have an animated conversation  or a minute or two after which the interpreter says, “No, she doesn’t have any pain.” It is reasonable to assume that there is uncertainty about the content of  the discussion between interpreter and patient. You cannot evaluate the patient’s story or answers unless you know how the questions were asked. Your only recourse is to ask short concrete questions and insist that the resulting conversation be no longer than you judge  necessary.


Chief complaint 

Begin the record with CC, the symptom that precipitated the visit. Complaints should be listed as single words or short phrases with the approximate length of  time they have been present:  for example, nausea  for 2 months; vomiting  for 1 week. Use the patient’s own words  free of  interpretation. Do not accept a previous diagnosis as a CC; probing may be needed before the patient relates their symptoms rather than their diagnoses or those of  previous providers and  family members.

The CC is the starting place  for making a differential diagnosis; the details of  the symptoms should always be  fully elucidated. Since these are the symptoms  for which the patient sought care, they will require therapy or an explanation of  why therapy is not given. The patient’s CC should be the  1st problem on your problem list. This would seem obvious, but occasionally the physician  finds an interesting disease, unrelated to the CC; the medically attractive condition receives all the attention, and the CC is ignored.

History of present illness. The HPI is the patient’s story of  their illness experience; it is the  most important par t of the  diagnostic  examination. It should be recorded in complete sentences as a lucid, succinct, and chronologic narrative. Ideally, the HPI should be brief , so that it is easily read and digested, but this is only possible if  the history is relatively straight forward. Some stories are complex and the diagnostic possibilities broad, requiring inclusion of  more detail since you can’t be certain what is pertinent and what superfluous. 
You must avoid premature interpretation such as replacing their words with medical terminology or  failing to record seemingly irrelevant symptoms or events.
**The chief  purpose of  the history is to help you  form diagnostic hypotheses


Past medical history 

The past history helps you understand the person you are evaluating and the preconditions that may substantially alter current and  future risks  or specific  health conditions. When relevant, specific  acts may be included in the HPI, but they must be recorded again in this section. The significance of  past illnesses may only be appreciated after  future developments in the patient’s condition or as newly recognized disease associations are reported.

General health. The patient’s lifetime health, before the present illness, is sometimes revealing. Factors to consider include body weight (present, maxi- mum, and minimum, with dates of each), previous PEs (dates and  findings), and any periods of  medical disability.

Chronic and episodic illnesses Chronic medical illness. List all illnesses, diseases, or conditions  or which the patient receives, or has received, chronic medical treatment.

Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases have had an important history in medicine. Knowledge o  past infections is important to understand current and  future infection risk. List dates and complications of  these illnesses with particular attention to hepatitis, rheumatic  fever, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV. Give dates and duration of  antibiotic treatment.

Operations and injuries. Give dates and nature of  injuries, operations, operative diagnoses, and infection, hemorrhage, blood transfusions, or other complications.

Previous hospitalizations. Record each hospitalization, including the dates, names, and location of  hospitals. If the hospital records are available, summarize the dates and diagnoses  or each admission.

Family history  : A FH is essential  or all patients receiving more than the most cursory care. This should include  four generations, when available: grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, siblings, and children. For parents and grand- parents, record the birth year and current health or age at death and causes. For aunts, uncles, siblings, and children, record the birth year,  1st name, and cur- rent health or cause of  death and age at death. Make note of  any FH of  hyper- tension, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune diseases, gout, atopy, asthma, obesity, endocrine disorders, osteoporosis, cancer (particularly breast, colon, ovarian, and endocrine cancers), hemophilia or other bleeding diseases, venous thromboembolism, stroke, migraine, neurologic or muscular disorders, mental or emotional disturbances, substance abuse, and epilepsy.

Social history 

Place of birth,Nationality, ethnicity, and language,Marital status,Occupations.

Military history  : It is important to note military service by branch, geo graphic locations, discharge (honorable or dishonorable), and eligibility  or veteran’s benefits 

Social and economic status. Record the patient’s years of   formal education, vocational training, current living arrangements, and any  financial problems.

Habits. Determine the patient’s  former and current use o  tobacco, coffee, alcohol, sedatives, illicit drugs (especially injection drug use), tattoos, and body piercing.

Violence and safety. Record the patient’s use of  vehicle restraints, bicycle and motorcycle helmets, and the presence of  home smoke and carbon monoxide alarms

Prostheses and in-home assistance. Record the patient’s use of  eyeglasses, dentures and dental appliances, hearing aides, ambulation assistance devices (cane, walker, scooter, wheelchair), braces, prosthetic  footwear, and any aide or assistance received in the home (visiting nurse, physical therapy, home- maker services).

Review of systems 

The  following outline can help inquire  or symptoms associated with each system or anatomic region. Symptoms related to the patient’s current problem, discovered during your ROS inquiry, should be recorded in the HPI. Become  familiar with these symptoms and learn their diagnostic significance: record positive answers and negative responses when they are pertinent to the differential diagnosis. It is efficient to ask the questions while examining the body to which the questions pertain. Use of  a standardized check in questionnaire will  facilitate a thorough review and save time.

Medication : Keep a list of  current medications by name, dose, effect, indication, and duration of  use. Ask the patient to bring the original containers with the labels. If  the labels are absent, call the pharmacy where they were dispensed. Be sure to list all nonprescription drugs, herbal remedies, supplements, and vitamins.

Allergies And Medication  Intolerances : Untoward drug reactions should be as explicit as possible. Ask  for the type of  reaction or intolerance experienced. 
Common side effects may be incorrectly identified as allergies:  for example, stomach upset with codeine or erythromycin. Identify known or suspected causes o  anaphylaxis (drugs, stings, and  foods, e.g., peanuts). This summary of  allergies and medication intolerances must be consulted when drugs are being prescribed

Laboratory: Record the results of  the laboratory results used in developing your differential diagnosis

Assessment 

Case summary. It is sometimes useful to write a brief  abstract of  the history and significant observations
The problem list and assessment. A working problem list should be maintained with notes and dates indicating their status. The problem list records each of  the diagnostic and management problems that need to be addressed. 
A problem may be a symptom, a sign, a laboratory  finding, or a cluster of  several associated items. A previously confirmed disease may be listed as a problem. By constantly reviewing the problem list, you assure that every problem is being evaluated and managed. It is important to update and revise the problem list.
Generate a differential diagnosis  for each medical problem, the differential diagnosis can be pathophysiologic, diagnostic, or both. It is a good practice to keep the patient’s CC as the  1st problem.Beyond that, we do not  feel that attempts to number the problem list in a prioritized or numerically consistent  fashion is useful; priorities change as the evaluation and treatment proceed and problems disappear or consolidate as more information is acquired.
Diagnostic problem solving is much like putting together a jigsaw puzzle without the picture and with only a  few pieces provided at a time. To eventually solve the puzzle, you place the pieces on the table and, as new pieces appear, keep trying different arrangements until the pattern emerges. 
The problem list is your table full of  pieces; your hypotheses are attempts to explain the pattern. It is often the odd piece that does not seem to  fit anywhere that is the key to the puzzle. When the diagnosis is obscure, beware of  lumping problems together prematurely; this may serve to obscure rather than to clarify the diagnosis.

The plan:For each problem, and the patient as a whole, you need to develop a management plan. The plan  or each problem has three parts: (1) plans  or testing your hypothesis, (2) therapy to be considered or given, and (3) education  or the patient and  family.
a  plan is only  as good  as the  diagnostic hypotheses that generated it. Our emphasis in this text is to help you think about the information acquired in the history and physical exam so that you can generate sound, testable hypotheses. Once you have generated a concise differential diagnosis, you can consult textbooks and/or search the medical literature to  find an efficient method  for testing your hypotheses.

Inpatient progress notes:Progress notes are made daily and additionally whenever necessary. Each note should be dated and the time of  day recorded. 
Each note has  our subheads. Use the mnemonic SOAP to remember them: Subjective data (symptoms and changes in symptoms, their appearance and disappearance, and their response to therapy); Objective data (changes in or new physical signs and laboratory  findings and response to therapy); assessments (updates to your problem list and hypotheses); and Plans (diagnostic tests, therapeutic interventions and instructions to the patient and nursing staff  ). When a problem is resolved by inclusion in another diagnosis, or by cure or disappearance, it should be so noted in the progress note and in the working problem list.
The  full and legible name of  the writer is appended to each progress note. The name should be  followed by a slash mark and an abbreviation indicating hospital role, that is, MD (resident), RN (student nurse or graduate), S (staff  ), etc.

Discharge summary : When the patient leaves the hospital, a discharge summary is created containing the principle diagnosis and all problems addressed during the hospitalization, an abstract of  the history and hospital course,  future plans, and each medication by dose and schedule, noting new, discontinued, or changed medications. Note the patient’s condition and  functional status at discharge and any information or instructions given to the patient and attendants  for home and  follow-up care.

physician’s signature  : Every physician note and order should be signed and dated as proof  of  authorship. Dates should include the month, day of  the month, year, and time of  day. In teaching hospitals, where many persons contribute to the record, the entries of  medical students and nurses should be dated and accompanied by their signatures with suitable abbreviations indicating their status

Chief Complaint:
"swelling of tongue and difficulty breathing and swallowing"

History of Present Illness:
77 y o woman in NAD with a h/o CAD, DM2, asthma and HTN on altace for 8 years awoke from sleep around 2:30 am this morning of a sore throat and swelling of tongue. She came immediately to the ED b/c she was having difficulty swallowing and some trouble breathing due to obstruction caused by the swelling. She has never had a similar reaction ever before and she did not have any associated SOB, chest pain, itching, or nausea. She has not noticed any rashes, and has been afebrile. She says that she feels like it is swollen down in her esophagus as well. In the ED she was given 25mg benadryl IV, 125 mg solumedrol IV and pepcid 20 mg IV. This has helped the swelling some but her throat still hurts and it hurts to swallow. Nothing else was able to relieve the pain and nothing make it worse though she has not tried to drink any fluids because of trouble swallowing. She denies any recent travel, recent exposure to unusual plants or animals or other allergens. She has not started any new medications, has not used any new lotions or perfumes and has not eaten any unusual foods. Patient has not taken any of her oral medications today.

Assessment and Plan:
77 yo woman presents with significant angioedema in left side of tongue and inner cheek. Possible causes of angioedema include allergic anaphylaxis reaction, drug induced, allergic contact dermatitis, viral infection, drug induced, or a C1 inhibitor deficiency disorder acquired or hereditary. Laryngeal edema can also be caused by tonsillitis, peritonsilar abscess or pharyngeal foreign body.

It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does not have any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swelling also argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anything when they scoped her.

It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascular permeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators include allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell release caused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this type of reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which the patient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food, lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. The patient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar to this in the past

It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.

Other possibilities in the differential of causes of swelling include cellulitis, autoimmune conditions including SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and sjorgren’s syndrome.
Hypothyroidism can cuase puffiness of face and lips, hyperthyroidism can cause an infiltrative dermopathy, superior vena cava syndrome and tumors can cause venous engorgement and swelling. It is not likely one of these etiologies since the patient is on
an ACEI and the swelling is restricted only to her tongue and throat typical of ACEI angioedema.

Plan:
++Swollen tongue:
Give patient corticosteroid to decrease inflammation and to protect against relapse after initial improvement. 4 days of Dexamethasone 10 mg IV tid.
Give patient antihistamine to block inflammation as well. 4 days of Diphenhydramine 25 mg bid.
ENT consult to rule out abscess or foreign object
Check C1 and C4 levels that would be decreased if the patient had C1 inhibitory complement deficiency
TSH level to check for hypo/hyper thyroid
Hold all oral home meds and keep patient NPO until airway swelling is reduced and patient can swallow easily

++Asthma/COPD
continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs prn
resume theophylline when patient can take oral meds

++DM
Not on oral home meds
Patient is on corticosteroids that increase blood glucose levels, so put patient on sliding scale normal insulin to adjust for high sugars
Resume neurontin for neuropathy when oral meds can be taken

++HTN
Continue patient’s BP control with Diltiazem drip 5mg/hour
HOLD altace (ACEI) that is most likely the cause of angioedema
Consider an alternative HTN medication to replace the ACEI. Can’t use a HCTZ because of sulfa allergy. Also has asthma/COPD picture so beta blocker may not work well either.

++CAD s/p PCI in 1999
Resume simvastatin and aspirin when patient is able to take oral meds

++GERD
famotidine when oral meds are resumed
